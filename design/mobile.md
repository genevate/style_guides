# Mobile Design Styles

## General

- Design for mobile first starting with the smallest design and responsively working up to the
  largest design.
- Design for thumb navigation/input as it's the most used and bluntest of all fingers.
  - Keep navigation at the bottom of the screen for easy access via the thumb while holding the
    device in one hand.
  - Use icons that are big enough to be tapped, bluntly, with a thumb.
  - Use big primary buttons that are easy to see and interact with.
  - Use menus that can fan out in a circle or semi-circle so there is little movement required to
    slide/scroll to the desired action.
