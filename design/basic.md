- Psychology.
- Neuroscience.
- Linguistics.
- Sociology.
- Philosophy.
- Understanding Humans.

In order to to:

- Enlighten
- Amuse
- Delight
- Empower

We all have one chance at this life, why not make it a good one - a memorable one.

## General

- Build upon existing, common design standards.
- Use negative space - Separate navigation from content, sections from bodies, text from images,
  etc.
- Use plenty of headings to help the reader scan for what is most relevant.
- Use short paragraphs which get to the point quickly.
- Use designs that strive to be clear, obvious, and self-explanatory.
- Avoid sacrificing functionality over beauty.
- Avoid heavy explanations/instructions.

## Site Logo

- Should include the company/site icon/branding.
- Should include the company/site name.
- Should include the site tagline (unless provided as ancillary text to logo image).

## Tag Lines

- Should be six to eight characters in length (max).
- Must be clear and informative.
- Must convey the overall value proposition for the site.
- Should be included with the site logo or as part of the main header.

## Navigation

- Navigation should be effortless without loosing a sense of where one is in the hierarchy.
- Keep navigation level depth to five clicks or less - it shouldn't require a lot of clicking to
  find content.
- Always make actionable elements (i.e. links, buttons) clearly standout with minimum thought for
  action.
- Use tabbed navigation:
  - Always associate the active tab with the current page (using a prominent color, font size, etc.)
  - When hovering over tabs, each tab being hovered should be visibly highlighted.
- Use a site logo:
  - Always have it link to the home page.
  - Associate it with main site navigation at all times so that people know they are still on the
    same site.
- Use a search form:
  - Associate it with main site navigation.
  - Keep it small but easy to see.
  - Always label it as "Search" and nothing else.
  - Always search for entire site content from a single form.
- Use page labels:
  - Must be present on every page (generally top-left corner of page, depending on site design).
  - Must always match the same text used in the navigation link.
  - Must be prominent of and of a larger font than the rest of the page content.
- Use breadcrumbs:
  - Use for deeply nested hierarchies.
  - Should be located at the top of the page content (above the page title).
  - Use '>' to indicate hierarchy (better than ':', '|', '/' because it better visuallizes depth).
  - Use a small font. It shouldn't take up a lot of space.
  - The last item in the breadcrumbs should be identical to the page label.

## Home Page

- Must clearly answer the following:
  - Why does this site exist?
  - What is the site for and what can be found on this site?
  - Where does one get started?
- Must accomplish the following:
  - Establish trust and credibility - First impressions are everything.
  - Provide registration (if necessary).
  - Provide teasers so that other areas of the site may be explored.
  - Provide timely content/updates.
  - Provide shortcuts to the most frequent content.
  - Should remain focused and uncluttered (especially over time and repeated use).
- Must contain the following:
  - A welcome blurb - A brief description of the why and what of the site.
  - Efficient use of space - donâ€™t overfill with explanation text.

## Text

- Refrain from happy/promotional text - This is filler text that doesn't provide any useful
  information. Instead, get to the point and make each word count. Be ruthless in removing
  extraneous words.

## Lists

- Use bullet lists to group related items.
- Use a space between list items.

## Loading

- Avoid loading indicators as the user experience is perceived to take longer even if the
  performance is the same or better than it was. Use skeleton screens instead.
- Use skeleton screens to show a vague layout of what will be loaded by slowly filling in the
  content as it loads. This improves perception of the overall wait time and provides more
  information than a blank screen or a loading indicator.
