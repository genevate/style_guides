# Dossier Styles

In order to effectively collaborate with others, it's nice to have a dossier on all members of the
team. This removes the awkardness of getting to know someone and provides a foundation for which to
establish stronger bonds.

## Roster

All team member profiles should be part of a company roster that is easy to lookup and search
through.

## Profiles

Each team member should have the following profile information:

- **Avatar** - Needs to be a professional or semi-professional head shot of yourself.
- **Name** - Your full name.
- **Tagline** - A short one-sentence blurb that summarizes who you are.
- **Bio** - A few brief paragraphs that summaries your history.
- **Links** - Allow links to social media, web sites, source code, etc.
- **Dossier** - See *dossier questions* listed below. These should have protected access to team
  members only but can be marked public if desired.

## Questions

Each person on your team should fill out the answers to these questions. Be honest!

- What is your primary goal in life?
- What is your superpower?
- What is your weakness?
- What are your primary skills?
- What is your favorite mode of communication?
- What annoys you?
  - How would someone help you when annoyed?
- What are your favorite hobbies?
- What environment is best suited for you to work effectively?
- Are you intrinsically or extrinsically motivated?
- Are you introverted or extraverted?
- How do you like to learn (i.e. articles/books, tutorials, lectures, screencasts, etc.)?
- How do you prefer to receive feedback?
- How do you prefer to receive praise/recognition?
- What do you need from your company?
- What do you need from your manager?
