# Dossier Styles

In order to effectively collaborate with others, it's nice to have a dossier on all members of the
team. This removes the awkwardness of getting to know someone and provides a foundation for which to
establish stronger bonds.

## Roster

All team member profiles should be part of a company roster that is easy to lookup and search
through.

## Profiles

Each team member should have the following profile information:

- **Avatar** - Needs to be a professional or semi-professional head shot of yourself.
- **Name** - Your full name.
- **Tagline** - A short one-sentence blurb that summarizes who you are.
- **Bio** - A few brief paragraphs that summaries your history.
- **Chronotype** - What are your best hours of productive, [well-rested](https://is.gd/TGguix)
  action.
- **Links** - Allow links to social media, web sites, source code, etc.
- **Dossier** - See *dossier questions* listed below. These should have protected access to team
  members only but can be marked public if desired.
