# Leadership Styles

## Guidelines

0. Earn and maintain the respect and trust of your team.
0. Empower teammates with the autonomy to be creative and solve problems.
0. Allow teammates to gain/achieve mastery.
0. Empower teammates with a sense of purpose/drive.
0. Protect teammates from daily distractions and interruptions.
0. Identify weaknesses and focus on turning them into strengths but also build upon existing
   strengths.
0. Be human. Strive to make a connection with each and every one of your teammates so that you can
   understand who they are, what drives them, and how best to help them grow.
0. Be honest:
    - Be quick to constructively criticise. The longer you wait, the worse the situation will become.
    - Give praise but only when it is sincere and meaningful. Get this wrong and you'll do more
      damage than never giving praise in the first place. Plus, you'll lose credibility and respect.
0. Be transparent: Share information often, clearly, and concisely.
0. Be empathetic and caring -- Strive to understand what motivates people:
    - Past: Listen to where they came from, what makes them tick, and how they got to where they are
      now.
    - Present: Listen to what they think of the current situation, how they feel about it, and how
      they would change it.
    - Future: Listen to what drives them, where they are excited about going, and how you can help
      in these endeavors.
0. Be a good listener:
    - Maintain consistently scheduled
      [1x1 meetings](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster).
    - Encourage an open channel of communication and honest feedback.
    - Tackle and resolve issues as they arise.
    - Grab a room if information is sensitive but otherwise go for a walk, grab a drink at a local
      tea shop, or get out of the office altogether.
0. Be a teacher, always.
0. Be decisive but not a dictator:
    - Always base decisions on productivity not politics.
    - Never mandate how work will be performed/completed.
    - Facilitate and listen. Let the team come to their own conclusions.
    - Debate and clarify all decisions.
    - Negotiate diversity and resistance into resolved actions.
    - Don't be afraid to delegate decisions to people that know the information better than you.
    - Don't defer decisions to senior staff when people, in the meeting, know the information
      better.
0. Be cautious of high performers:
    - The occurance of these types of individuals is extremely rare.
    - Warning signs of perceived high output:
      - Not spending the necessary time to architect and design software using good design patterns.
      - Failure to craft code that is self-documenting, easy to read, and easy to maintain.
      - Failure to avoid code smells.
      - Failure to adequately test.
0. Be a motivator. Do this for every teammate by taking action, when necessary, to engage people in
   the mission and vision of the team/company.
0. Be accountable. Be responsible for tasks assigned to the team and hold teammates to the same
   standard for their work accordingly.
0. Be focused on quality:
    - Encourage tackling every feature, bug, issue, etc. as a chance to pay down technical dept,
      refactor, and carve complex code into smaller (easier to read) pieces of functionality.
    - Encourage diligence in deleting old/unused code/features.
    - Baking continual improvement/refinement as a core team value encourages mastery, automony, and
      a strong sense of purpose making the team happier in the long run to achieve higher results.
      *It should not be underestimated how important a morale boost this is.*
0. Be a peer to the team.
0. Be additional help when help is needed.
0. Be encouraging of code ownership:
    - Craft engineers, not bards (a.k.a. a jack/jill of all trades but master of none). Abandon the
      notion that team members are replacable cogs that need to have shared knowledge across all
      code bases. Instead, allow for code ownership of specific code bases instead. Provide the
      ability for each team member to slowly and carefully build knowledge and expertise in the
      various pillars of your architecture. They can eventually move on to other pillars but let
      them become masters first.
0. Be on the lookout for natural leaders:
    - These are the people that other team members constantly seek out for advice/help.
    - It's important that these individuals be publically recognized with appropriate title when
      promoted.
0. Be accommodating:
    - When employees ask for better equipment, flexible schedules, etc. do it. Unless the requests
      are ceaseless or the request would impact budget in a significant manner, do it. *Again, don't
      underestimate the morale boost this provides.*
0. Remember that excellent management doesn't scale. Limit your time and attention team to five
   people or less.
0. Have faith and confidence in your team.

# Tactics

The following is taken word-for-word from [My Management Lessons from Three Failed Startups, Google, Apple, Dropbox, Twitter and Square](http://www.timeforpool.com/2/post/2014/02/my-management-lessons-from-three-failed-startups-google-apple-dropbox-twitter-and-squareread.html):

- **Give excellent ratings to everyone who is performing exceptionally**: Even at some of the best
  companies, people who have valuable skills but who aren’t likely to “take over the world,” will
  often be rated as meeting expectations because managers reserve high ratings for people they're
  going to promote. This creates an unhealthy promotion- obsessed culture.
- **Put the gradual growth achievers in positions where they can train others**: Capitalize on their
  dependency, their thoroughness, and their dedication to the company. They will be your best
  teachers, and it’s a way to put them on stage even when they shy away from the spotlight. “Don’t
  promote them,” Scott advises. “They don’t want to be promoted. If you make them a manager, you’ll
  destroy an asset.”
- **Don’t ignore the middle**: Very few people are truly mediocre. “If someone has been somewhere
  more than two years and has just met expectations the whole time, it’s time to ask yourself the
  hard question: If they weren’t there could you hire somebody more likely to excel?
- **Evaluate skilled underperformers**: If somebody is not doing well in their role but is talented,
  it’s time to look at yourself in the mirror: Have you put this person in the wrong role? Is your
  management style just a bad fit for the person? Is this person experiencing a temporary personal
  problem?
- **Make the tough calls**: If someone truly is bad at their job and they are unlikely ever to
  improve — that’s key — you have to fire them. “Don’t put it off. All that’s going to do is piss
  off your top performers and burn them out,” Scott says. “It may seem harsh, but it’s also harsh to
  let your top performers carry the burden for underperformers.”

## Growth Trajectories (for high performing employees)

- Steep (can be high maintenance and might not stay in one place for long):
  - Push them to tackle new challenges.
  - Cleary define their path to promotion.
  - Make them your thought partner.
  - Don't ignore them because of their independence or belief they don't need to be managed.
- Slow (stable and tend to remain in their roles for some time)
  - Honor them for the great work they do because, very often, they go unrecognized.
