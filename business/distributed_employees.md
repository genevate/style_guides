## Things to Do

- *Always* treat distributed workers as first class citizens. Helps if the founder/manager of the
  company is remote too.
- It helps, but is not a requirement, if people know each other well (personality types,
  temperaments, etc) before enabling a team to become distributed.
- Team members who are generally quiet, focused, self motivated, disciplined, and like to work in
  distraction free environments tend to shine in distributed work environments. These are the people
  you want to hire.
- Maintain 1x1 meetings on a weekly basis. Keep them to 30 minutes but allow for longer if
  necessary. It is important to address concerns quickly and keep morale high. If left unaddressed,
  these issues can compound quickly.
- Ensure distributed workers are empowered to do their job and do it well:
    - Ensure any potential roadblock and/or managerial intervention is removed.
    - Ensure everyone has access to required resources.
    - Give each employee a company credit card and allow them to use it within reason.
    - Allow everyone to take vacation when necessary/needed. Allow each to coordinate with team
      members on scheduling.
- Watch for burnout by giving people time off and preventing people from overwork (i.e. more than 40
  hours/week):
    - Maybe give every Friday off during the summer months.
    - Enable further learning (like cooking, dancing, playing an instrument) to augment current
      skills.
    - Host a company retreat, etc. to get face-to-face time with fellow employees.
- Encourage employees to work from different locations (i.e. library, coffee shop, home, different
  cities, countries, etc). A change of location can inspire and get people to think about problems
  differently.
- Encourage employees to proactively set/share goals, create projects, and recommend solutions.
- Encourage employees to stay connected and be responsible for letting everyone know when they are
  not available and for how long.
- Encourage employees to constantly adapt and learn new methodologies, technologies, etc.

## Things to Avoid

- Avoid snippy-comments and feedback.
- Avoid passive aggressive responses.
- Avoid any type of mean, aggressive, or jerk-like behavior.
