# Workspace Styles

## General

- Avoid open office design by all means. It is extremely counterproductive for optimal software
  devlepment performance and happiness. Use private offices/workspaces instead. Better yet, avoid
  offices altogether and be remote-first focused instead. See [Remote Employee Styles](remotes.md)
  for details.
