## Dynamics

[Google learned](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team) there are
five key dynamics that set successful teams apart from other teams:

1. **Psychological Safety**: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
   Team members should feel sale and able to be vulnerable in front of each other.
1. **Dependability**: Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
1. **Structure and Clarity**: Are goals, roles, and execution plans clear?
1. **Meaning**: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
1. **Impact**: Do we fundamentally believe the work we are doing matters?
