## General

- When the team is distributed, automate the scheduling of 30 minute 1x1's where the new hire can
  casually hang out with each individual team member via video chat.
- When the team is local, give the new hire a gift card which they can use to take staff out for
  tea/coffee in order to connect with staff, learn more about the team, and become known. This will
  encourage existing staff to meet and hang out with the new hire as well.

## First Day

Help the new hire set up a working environment, deliver a bug fix and/or new feature, and push
changes into production.

## First Week

Ask lots of questions. Pair with the team. Take lots of notes. Provide feedback and observations to
the team as your perspective is invaluable due to observing existing processes with fresh eyes.

## First Month

Keep asking questions, pair when necessary, and take lots of notes.

## First Quarter

Begin to suggest bigger improvements but be subtle about it. You're still establishing yourself so
don't press too hard until you can build up more influence.

## First Six Months

By this time, you should have a decent understanding of the company, team, and software stack. You
might not have 100% working knowledge but you know where most things are or how to find them
quickly.

You should have established yourself in a few key areas and can be working to become more of an
influencer of change/improvement.

## First Year

Have an overall sense of the team, company, and your role within it. Are you having an impact or are
you another cog in the wheel? This is always a critical point because if you are not seeing enough
growth you might have to make plans for moving on to other opportunities or dig in more because you
see untapped potential. By this point, you should definitely know what that is.
