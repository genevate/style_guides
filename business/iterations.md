## Overview

Many businesses typically like to schedule meetings for planning, status, demos, etc. This is time
consuming and wasteful of company time. Instead, focus on being productive and enabling everyone to
do their best work via the following:

- **Schedule**: Use a one-week interval starting on Monday and ending on Friday.
- **Status**: Each day, when people start their day (respective of time) zone, everyone reports
  their status. *That's it!*

## Plans

Planning during an iteration falls out during daily status updates from the team. There is no need
to schedule a reoccurring meeting for this. If a meeting is required, it can be done ad-hoc and as
needed (usually this is rare). Every team member is empowered to adjust and course correct
appropriately. If the team is larger, then a product manager might organize, manage, and communicate
to everyone a change in plans/schedules.

## [Statuses](https://m.signalvnoise.com/status-meetings-are-the-scourge)

This is the daily heartbeat of your team. Avoid meetings by writing everything down for quick
reference, searchability, and avoiding interrupting anyone's flow.

- Performed daily at the start of each person's day (respective of time zone).
- Team Chat Room Name: *Statuses*.
- Format:
  - Previous actions.
  - Next actions.
  - Blockers (if any).
- Use video chat for quick meetings when necessary.

## [Retrospectives](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2019/04/30/how-to-facilitate-an-effective-retro)

There is *only one meeting* you truly need and that is the retrospective. This is how the team
learns from mistakes/failures, heals, and grows. These are never a waste of time as working through
issues as they arise leads to a healthy evolution of the team/culture. It also helps build bonds
between all members of the team.

A useful service for [facilitating](https://blog.trello.com/sprint-retrospective-meeting) a retro is
[Fun Retro](https://funretro.io).

- Performed, end-of-day, every Friday.
- Team Chat Room Name: *Retros*.
- Use video chat as necessary.
- Topics of discussion *must* be created prior to the start of the meeting. Ideally, everyone is
  adding ideas for the next retro as they occur.
- Format:
  - **Previous Actions**: This is a quick review of actions from the last retro that have been
    completed. Otherwise, it's a status update (in case they are longer running). Ideally, previous
    actions should be completed prior to the next retro.
  - **Sad**: List what didn't work. Prefix each topic with: *I wish* . It is best to start with
    these as they are the most important and usually require follow-up actions.
  - **Confused**: List what was confusing. Prefix each topic with: *I wonder*.
  - **Happy**: List what worked well. Prefix each topic with: *I like*.
  - **Next Actions**: Follow up all discussions with next actions (if any). Ensure these are
    assigned to individuals who are able to complete the work before the next retro.

## Demos

Demos are a great way to share the joy of what you are working on with others who might not be as
involved. They are also a great way to solicit feedback from others.

- Posted when interesting work is available for anyone interact with.
- Team Chat Room Name: *Demos*.
- Post demos (screencast and/or web articles related to the finished work).
