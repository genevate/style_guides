# Interviewee Styles

- Be prepared:
    - Your Portfolio:
        - Keep your online portfolio (i.e. Twitter, web site/syndicated feeds, open source work, etc.) and resume
          up-to-date.
        - Spellcheck everything you write.
        - Avoid buzzwords like the plague. Speak/write clearly for everything you describe.
    - First Contact:
        - Research the company and personalize your introductory message accordingly.
        - Register and use the product/service prior to the first interview.
        - Always respond with a follow-up email after the first interview.
    - First Interview:
        - Make sure you know the company dress code before appearing in person.
        - Know the date, time, and length of the interview (*double check the details - first impressions are critical*).
        - Know everyone involved in the interview. Write down the names/roles and keep them with you the entire time.
- Be honest. You'll earn more respect by stating you don't know the answer and will avoid future questioning of deeper
  knowledge that can't be supported.
- Be humble. If asked to rate/estimate something, answer with a response lower than you might think. It is better to set
  a realistic expectation with room to surprise rather than a lofty goal that can't be reached/delivered.
- Be positive. Maintain a enthusiastic outlook, even under the duress of questioning and testing.
- Be relaxed. It's a two-way street - You're interviewing the company too!
- Be inquisitive. Do your homework and ask lots of questions. Everyone loves to talk about themselves - Use that to your
  advantage. Questions to ask:
    - Work/Life Balance:
        - How are remote employees supported?
            - How many founders/leaders work remotely?
            - What is the level of involvement (first class citizens, included in critical decisions, etc)?
            - What technology is used?
        - What hours are required (strict or flexible)?
        - What does a typical developer day consist of?
        - What does a typical developer week consist of?
    - Structure:
        - What is the organizational structure of the company? Ask them to draw/provide a diagram so you can understand
          the lay of the land and what your position in it will be.
        - What is the future growth of this structure?
        - What is the future growth for your proposed position?
    - Communication:
        - How is email used?
        - How is group chat used?
        - How is content management used?
    - Teamwork:
        - How is pair programming performed?
        - How are new members indoctrinated/bootstrapped?
        - How are code reviews performed?
    - Technology:
        - What servers are used (local and/or cloud-based)?
        - What deployment software is used?
        - What databases are used?
        - What programming languages/frameworks are used?
        - What development environment is used (i.e. tech stack, tooling, etc)?
    - Outliers:
        - Does everyone use the software/product that is developed (*Critical: Do they eat their own dog food*)?
        - Would it be possible to work on the support team for a week or two, if hired?
        - What impact (primary clear win) would I have on the team, if hired?
        - What would make this position a total success, if hired?
        - What is the biggest question you really wanted to ask me but haven't yet?
- Be polite:
    - Never ask about salary (and definitely never in front of the entire team). Wait for an offer to arrive and always
      talk to the hiring manager directly.
    - Never ask how you did at the end of an interview. Receiving further inquiries will be your answer.
    - Never badmouth your former employeer - Speak positively as to why you are moving on.
- Be growing. Each interview is a learning experience. Consider interviewing once a year to keep your skills
  sharp and a pulse on the ever changing landscape.
