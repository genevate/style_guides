  - First Impression:
    - Research the company and personalize your introductory message accordingly.
    - Register and use the product/service prior to the first interview.
    - Always respond with a follow-up email after the first interview.
  - First Interview:
    - Make sure you know the company dress code before appearing in person.
    - Know the date, time, and length of the interview (*double check the details - first
      impressions are critical*).
    - Know everyone involved in the interview. Write down the names/roles and keep them with you the
      entire time.
- Be honest. You'll earn more respect by stating you don't know the answer and will avoid future
  questioning of deeper knowledge that can't be supported.
- Be humble. If asked to rate/estimate something, answer with a response lower than you might think.
  It is better to set a realistic expectation with room to surprise rather than a lofty goal that
  can't be reached/delivered.
- Be positive. Maintain a enthusiastic outlook, even under the duress of questioning and testing.
- Be relaxed. It's a two-way street - You're interviewing the company too!
- Be inquisitive. Do your homework and ask lots of questions. Everyone loves to talk about
  themselves - Use that to your advantage. Questions to ask:
  - Salary:
    - Before starting the interview process ensure you know what salary you desire and what the
      company can afford. Knowing this upfront avoids wasting time for you and company in an
      interview process that might have been mismatched to begin with.
  - Work/Life Balance:
    - How are remote employees supported?
        - How many founders/leaders work remotely?
        - What is the level of involvement (first class citizens, included in critical decisions,
          etc)?
        - What technology is used?
    - What hours are required (strict or flexible)?
    - What does a typical developer day consist of?
    - What does a typical developer week consist of?
  - Inclusivity:
    - What is the female to male ratio of engineering and executive teams?
    - What is the ratio of novice to experienced engineers?
    - What is the age range range of all staff?
  - Structure:
    - What is the organizational structure of the company? Ask them to draw/provide a diagram so you
      can understand the lay of the land and what your position in it will be.
    - What is the future growth of this organization?
    - What is the future growth for your proposed position?
  - Communication:
    - How is group chat used?
    - How is email used?
    - How is documentation organized?
  - Team:
    - What is the retention rate of engineers and staff in general?
    - How is collaboration/pairing performed?
    - How are new members indoctrinated/bootstrapped?
    - How are code reviews performed?
  - Technology:
    - What servers are used (local and/or cloud-based)?
    - What deployment software is used?
    - What databases are used?
    - What programming languages/frameworks are used?
    - What development environment is used (i.e. tech stack, tooling, etc)?
  - Finance:
    - What has revenue looked like over the past couple of years?
    - What does the compensation package look like (i.e. stocks, equity, bonuses, health)?
    - What does the promotion/skill ladder look like and is there a clear path for growth?
  - Outliers:
    - *Does everyone use the software/product that is developed?*
    - What impact (primary clear win) would I have on the team, if hired?
    - What would make this position a total success, if hired?
    - What is the biggest question you wanted to ask me but haven't yet?
- Be polite:
  - Avoid asking how you did at the end of an interview -- Receiving further inquiries will be your
    answer.
  - Avoid badmouthing your former employeer - Speak positively as to why you are moving on and the
    lessons learned from that experience.
- Be growing. Each interview is a learning experience. Consider interviewing once a year to keep
  your skills sharp and a pulse on the ever changing landscape.
