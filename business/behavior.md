## The Three Tenants of Motivation

These are the guiding principles of what motivates people to accomplish great things:

1. *Autonomy* - The freedom and ability to get things done. Requires control over Task, Team, Time,
   and Technique.
1. *Mastery* - To gain thorough knowledge and experience of a subject.
1. *Purpose* - The passion and drive to focus on the things that matter most.

## Maintaining Happiness

- Have a sense of meaning (i.e. drive -- see above).
- Smile often. It releases chemicals within the brain and body. It also is contagious amongst
  others.
- Leave personal issues at home. Avoid carrying over any of these issues into the workspace.
- Be future focused. Keeping an eye on goals and meeting those goals.
- Be thankful. It helps improves others sense of self-worth.
- Be relaxed. It's easy to get wrapped up in the heat of the moment. Taking the time to step away
  from the issue and compose yourself can have a huge effect on you and the people around you.
- Be healthy. Goes without saying that exercising and eat healthy food regularly is good for you.
- Be organized. Use sticky notes, software, etc. to stay on top of tasks and larger goals.
- Avoid multitasking. Despite the sense of feeling productive, it is not. More time is wasted than
  actually getting things done. Plus, it decreases concentration and creativity.
- Be accepting. You can't change who people are but you can find other ways to help or workaround
  them. Be patience and take the time to do this.
- Be moving. Take intermittent breaks and change positions in order keep the blood flowing and give
  your body time to adjust.
- Be sure to reward yourself of goals accomplished.
- Be reflective. Keep a journal and record the various events of the day. At the end of each day,
  reflect on these events. Think about what didn't work, what did work, and what can be improved.

## Behavior Improvement Steps

Apply the following steps in order to discover weaknesses and make improvements:

- Take an Autonomy Audit - On a scale of 1-10, rank the following (with 10 being the highest):
  - How much autonomy do you have over your tasks in a given day?
  - How much autonomy do you have over your time in a given day?
  - How much autonomy do you have over your team (being able to choose the members you work with)?
  - How much autonomy do you have over your technique (how you solve problems)?
- Set random interrupt notifications. Write down what you are doing at the interruption. Are you in
   flow? Keep a log of this for a week and/or month to determine what needs improvement.
- Define, in one sentence, what your life purpose is.
- Ask yourself if you are better today than you were yesterday? Is progress being made? What needs
   to change?
- Take a year off every seven years to reflect, explore, and live life.
- Give yourself a performance review every month and figure out what worked and failed? Be brutally
   honest. Is progress being made? What needs to change?
- Maintain deliberate practice:
  - Measure and improve performance.
  - Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
  - Ask for constant feedback.
  - Focus ruthlessly on weaknesses and turn them into strengths.
  - Prepare for mental exhaustion.
- Keep asking yourself the following:
  - What gets you up in the morning?
  - What keeps you up at night?
  - What are you going to do about each?
