# Personal Behavior Styles

## The Three Tenants of Motivation

These are the guiding principles of what motivates people to accomplish great things:

0. Autonomy - The freedom and ability to get things done. Requires control over Task, Team, Time, and Technique.
0. Mastery - To gain thorough knowledge and experience of a subject.
0. Purpose - The passion and drive to focus on the things that matter most.

## Maintaining Happiness

0. Have a sense of meaning (i.e. drive -- see above).
0. Smile often. It releases chemicals within the brain and body. It also is contagious amongst others.
0. Leave personal issues at home. Avoid carrying over any of these issues into the workspace.
0. Be future focued. Keeping an eye on goals and meeting those goals.
0. Be thankful. It helps improves others sense of self-worth.
0. Be relaxed. It's easy to get wrapped up in the heat of the moment. Taking the time to step away from the issue
   and compose yourself can have a huge effect on you and the people around you.
0. Be healthy. Goes without saying that excercising and eat healthy food regularly is good for you.
0. Be organized. Use sticky notes, software, etc. to stay on top of tasks and larger goals.
0. Avoid multitasking. Despite the sense of feeling productive, it is not. More time is wasted than actually getting
   things done. Plus, it decreases concentration and creativity.
0. Be accepting. You can't change who people are but you can find other ways to help or workaround them. Be patience
   and take the time to do this.
0. Be moving. Take intermittent breaks and change positions in order keep the blood flowing and give your body time to
   adjust.
0. Be sure to reward yourself of goals accomplished.
0. Be reflective. Keep a journal and record the various events of the day. At the end of each day, reflect on these
   events. Think about what didn't work, what did work, and what can be improved.

## Behavior Improvement Steps

Apply the following steps in order to discover weaknesses and make improvements:

0. Set random interrupt notifications. Write down what you are doing at the interruption. Are you in flow?
Keep a log of this for a week and/or month to determine what needs improvement.
0. Define, in one sentence, what your life purpose is.
0. Ask yourself if you are better today than you were yesterday? Is progress being made? What needs to change?
0. Take a year off every seven years to reflect, explore, and live life.
0. Give yourself a performance review every month and figure out what worked and failed? Be brutally honest.
Is progress being made? What needs to change?
0. [Go oblique](https://twitter.com/Oblique_Chirps) when stuck. Read one of these each time you are stuck to give
your mind something to focus on while the subconscious chips away at the real problem.
0. Maintain deliberate practice:
  0. Measure and improve performance.
  0. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
  0. Ask for constant feedback.
  0. Focus ruthlessly on weaknesses and turn them into strengths.
  0. Prepare for mental exhaustion.
0. Keep asking yourself the following:
  0. What gets you up in the morning?
  0. What keeps you up at night?
  0. What are you going to do about each?
