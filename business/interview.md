## General

- Prefer portfolios:
  - Read what they are saying on social media
    (see [Twitter Style Guide](../communication/twitter.md) for example).
  - Read their syndicated feeds (RSS) - This is a great way to see how they communicate, express
    thoughts/ideas, what their experiences have been, and what they are passionate about.
  - Read through their open source code. This is where you can get a sense of thier engineering
    prowess. You'll want to spend a good portion of time researching here.
  - In the case where an interviewee doesn't have an online presence. Ask if it's possible to learn
    about their work in other ways (perhaps their work is private and you can get legal, temporary,
    access to review and discuss further).
- Allow resumes as a complement to portfolios:
  - Useful when the candidate doesn't have an online presence or publically available work (as
    mentioned above).
  - When interview process is almost to an end and you'd like a chronological view of their career
    journey.
- Avoid puzzles and esoteric challenges. Tricking people and demonstrating you have obscure
  knowledge they don't will exclude a wide array of qualified interviewees and send a clear message
  to others that this isn't a good work environment.
- Prefer writers.
  - Good writers means good communicators.
  - Introductory emails and/or open source documentation is a great indicator.
- Prepare for every interview by thoroughly researching their portfolio/resume. This includes you
  and *all team members* involved in the interview process. If you need a study group to build a
  common understanding of the interviewee, *do it*. This is *important* to show you truly care about
  the interviewee and their past experiences. It's the first step in establishing good rapport and
  trust. Additionally, it shows good will towards making the interview experience a positive one by
  appreciating and seeing them as an individual instead of a number. This can't be stressed enough
  as this is one of the major points of failure in getting to know an interviewee. First impressions
  are critical so make it outstanding!
- Assemble a stellar interview team:
  - Train team members in the art of interviewing, never bring them in cold.
  - Each interviewer should have completed all of the [Havard Implicit Bias
    Tests](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html), have a clear understanding of what
    their biases are, and how to correct them.
  - Ensure every team member can provide comprehensive/constructive feedback of each interviewee.
  - Ensure everyone's expectation of the interviewee is the same in terms of having a positive
    experience, qualities desired, interview goals, etc.
- Once the initial impression of the interviewee is formed, spend the rest of the interview asking
  questions that can change that impression. Keep it fluid by digging deeper where there is interest
  and letting the interviewee do the same.
- Take copius notes during the interview process in order to make a detailed analysis of the
  interviewee later.
- Strive to hire the best and brightest but realize not everyone is a superstar - The interviewee
  should be able to augment the team, fill-in gaps, get things done, and have the potential for
  further growth (both personally and for the team).
- Exit an interivew with a clear sense of whether the interviewee will strengthen the team,
  inspire change/new ideas, and improve the overall success of the company.

## Stages

The following details the stages of the interview process for each interviewee. Each is stage
described in order of importance. These stages are designed to filter out interviewees that might
not be fully qualified yet. This isn't a bad thing as it only means they need to earn more
experience before re-applying.

### I: Application

Use a *single page* to describe the company and hiring process. It should be easy to read/use so the
interviewee is able to get started quickly with minimal resistance.

#### Overview

Start with the *why*. *Why* is your company special and *why* would people be excited to work with
you?

#### Expectations

Define clear expectations. Roles, responsibilities, avenues of growth, etc. are all welcome here. A
bullet list is nice for this but feel free to be creative.

#### Benefits

Define all the benefits you offer. Again, a bullet list is great but be creative. You'll want to
list everything you provide. Add links for further details, if necessary. Example:

- Paid time off (including sick time).
- Paid holidays.
- Paid parental leave.
- Paid learning (schooling, tutorials, subscriptions, books, etc.)
- Paid conference time and expenses.
- Paid equipment/accessories.
- Health insurance.
- Vision insurance.
- Dental insurance.
- 401(k) and retirement.
- Short/Long term disability.
- Anything else of importance.

#### Form

This can reside on the same page as the application or be a seperate form. Whatever the workflow,
ensure it is easy to use. Example:

- **Name** (required) - The interviewee's full name.
- **Email** (required) - The interviewee's primary email address.
- **Location** (required) - The interviewee's primary location.
- **Programming Languages** (required) - The list of top languages the interviewee is skilled in.
- **Social URLs** (optional) - Can be single or multiple links.
- **Portfolio URLs** (optional) - Can be single or multiple links (i.e. personal web site, open
  source, etc).
- **Salary Expectations** (required) - Clarifies the range of what you can and can't afford.
- **Comments** (optional) - Allow for any random thoughts/highlights.

### II: First Impression

When meeting the interviewee for the first time, do this via video chat or in person (like at a tea
shop). The former is preferred as it is convenient, less time consuming for everyone involved, and
reflects the remote working environment.

Start by being inquisitive about them and then move into more job-specific questions. *Focus on
being kind, a good listener, non-judgemental, and creating a safe space for discussion.*

Watch body language. If the interviewee is nervous or anxious, determine the cause and figure out
what will make them most comfortable. *It's important the interviewee sense the interview, and
potential work environment, is a safe space for them to be who they are.*

Before asking questions, avoid asking questions that haven't been asked before or you don't have the
answers to. Start off with something fun like asking how their day is going, did they have a good
weekend, recent events in world news, etc.

The following is a list of questions that yield a great first impression:

- **Purpose**
  - What got you into software development?
  - How long have you been doing software development?
  - Why are you leaving your current job?
  - Why are you interested in working with us?
  - What are you career goals?
- **Mastery**
  - What are your strengths and/or superpowers?
  - What are your weaknesses and/or aspects of your career you are not interested in?
  - What methodologies and tools do you use to manage your workflow?
  - Can you explain your project maintenance practice?
  - When do you consider a piece of work to be finished?
- **Autonomy**
  - How long have you been doing distributed work?
  - How do you handle distractions?
  - What is your preferred way to work and get things done?
- **Communication**
  - What is the best way to collaborate on a project?
  - When in the middle of an iteration with an unexpected discovery or major change in
    functionality, how do you explain this to the rest of the team?
  - How do you handle disagreements with your proposal, methodology, and/or implementation yet
    ensure your opinion is heard?
- **Learning**
  - What are some of your favorite software engineering news feeds, books, podcasts, etc?
  - What have you read recently that has excited you or caused you to learn something new?
  - What is on your list of things to learn next?
  - What are you building or have recently built that is most exciting to you?
  - Have you mentored/taught others and do you have a mentor yourself?
- **Leadership**
  - Can you explain when you've had to take ownership of a situation/project?
  - Can you explain when you've had to recover from a difficult situation?
  - How have you handled mistakes and/or failures with software?
  - How have you handled mistakes and/or weakness of character in others?
- **Ethics**
  - How do you honor the contributions of others and why is that important?
  - How have you handled situations in which you confronted unfair, biased or cruel behavior in a
    work environment? This could be standing up for yourself or someone else.
  - How have you confronted illegal or unethical situations in the workplace (if any)?
- **Security**
  - What steps do you take to be secure (i.e. 30+ alpha/numeric/symbolic passwords, two-factor
    authentication, VPN, encrypted disks, total erasure after limited failed attempts, Pi-hole,
    etc)?
- **Technical**
  - What is the difference between Git rebase and merge workflows?
  - What is the difference between composition and inheritance?
  - What is a monad?
  - What is [TRUE](/programming/basic.md#true) design?
  - What is [SOLID](/programming/basic.md#solid) design?
  - What is the different between stubs, mocks, and spies when testing?

You may want to extend this list or set up another interviewing session to dig into specific
questions related to your software stack. For example, let's say your stack consists of: AWS,
PostgreSQL, Elm, and Ruby on Rails. You might want to ask questions about each language/framework. A
lot of this will become apparent during *Stage III* but sometimes it can help to ask these questions
up front.

### III: Software Engineering

There are a couple of paths to follow here and it depends on the individual and their situation. The
following details both with the first being the preferred approach.

#### One Week Interation

When an interviewee has a strong portfolio such as a syndicated feed, social presence, open source
code, etc (as mentioned in the general section above) it would be insulting to force the interviewee
to do a code challenge or spend more of their time proving themselves to you. They are impressive
enough and it's important to recognize that. In this situation, bring the interviewee in for a
weekly iteration with your team and *pay them* for it. *Repeat: You must pay them for their time as
they are doing real work and shows that you value their time.*

Regardless of whether you perform weekly iterations, schedule your week as follows:

- **Monday**: Plan out the week with the interviewee and the team. Encourage the interviewee to ask
  questions and pick up tasks of interest.
- **Tuesday:** Report progress and/or pick up new tasks.
- **Wednesday:** Report progress and/or pick up new tasks.
- **Thursday:** Report progress and/or pick up new tasks.
- **Friday:**
  - Report progress and/or pick up new tasks.
  - Have the interviewee, along with the rest of the team, demo and explain completed features
    and/or bugs fixed.
  - Schedule time for a formal review of interviewee's work with the team. Allow the interviewee to
    provide feedback on experiences with working in the code base, the business space, team/company
    culture, and anything else the interviewee might have observed.
  - End the day early by extending an offer to the interviewee or providing them feedback on what
    they could improve upon so they can try again later after they've gained more experience. Either
    way, end on a positive note because if it's not a good fit now then it might turn into something
    more fruitful in the future.

Doing an iteration like this is valuable as it provides a two-way discourse between you and the
interviewee. You get to learn:

- Their design process.
- Their implementation style.
- How they ask questions.
- How they handle being stuck and the time to resolution.
- How they deliver quality solutions.
- Their Git commit etiquette.
- How they communicate/pair with others.
- How they handle code reviews and resolve feedback.
- How they manage a bug/feature, implement, deliver, and handle any unforeseen production
  issues/customer feedback.
- ...etc...

At the same time, the interviewee is learning about the business, code base, team dynamics, culture,
etc. All of this is important as it allows both the team and the interviewee to determine if it's a
good long term fit. It's important both parties determine this quickly rather than several
weeks/months later when so much time and effort has been invested in the interviewee.

Lastly, don't forget to have time to hang out with the interviewee during the week casually or while
working together!

#### Implementation, Review, and Pairing

In this situation, where the interviewee can't schedule an entire week (which is definitely tough
for some), have them work on code when they are able to fit it into their schedule. It's good to be
flexible and considerate of the interviewee's schedule as they might be entertaining other offers,
traveling, handling currently employeed tasks, etc.

*Again, and this is important, pay them for their time.* Whether you schedule real work with them or
set up a series of business related code challenges, please be respectful of their time and effort.
It'll go a long way in showing you care about the interviewee.

When going down this path, allow the interviewee to work using their own tools but set time limits
(no more than two hours) so they don't overwork themselves to impress you.

Once the work is complete, spend time reviewing the code with the interviewee. Allow them to explain
their thought process and solution.

Finally, pair with the interviewee on either the original work or set up a specific session for
pairing together on existing code that needs to be refactored. Work through the code, together,
discussing a solution. Allow the interviewee to drive in this situation.

All of this is necessary to mimic, as close as possible, real working experience so both you and the
interviewee have a solid understanding of what life will be like if hired.

### IV: Review

After all stages of the interview process has been completed, it's time to gather as a team and
discuss notes. The notes need to be broken down by key areas of interest. Example:

- **Drive**
  - **Autonomy** - Can be given a task, owns it, and carries it through to completion while managing
    time and technique along the way.
  - **Mastery** - Has mastery over current skillset and tools. Is able to dive deep and gain
    thorough knowledge and experience of a subject.
  - **Purpose** - Has the passion and drive to focus on things that matter most. Stays curious,
    engaged, and has the endurance to see it through.
- **Communication** - Is a good listener and is able to communicate clearly and effectively either
  verbally or as written text.
- **Compassion** - Can listen and feel what others have or are experiencing; includes and
  appreciates the work of others; and demonstrates respect.
- **Ethical** - Has a strong moral compass, defends any who may be marginalized, avoids
  technologies/services that may be abusive and/or legally compromising, and can navigate a
  honorable course of action.
- **Organization** - Can keep the task at hand organized in terms of requirements, deliverables,
  schedules, notes, interupts, etc.
- **Analytical** - Can figure out solutions to hard problems based on previous experience, searching
  for answers, reading up on new solutions, and/or asking for help from others.
- **Professionalism** - Is humble, composed in heated situations, can take critical
  feedback, maintains an optimistic outlook, and appreciates excellence.
- **Growth** - This is the hardest and, sometimes, most difficult to measure but shouldn't be
  overlooked. When an interviewee is low scoring in terms of current skills, tools, breadth of
  knowledge, and generally rough around all edges *but* has the passion, eagerness to learn, and
  high level of curiosity, you might have stumbled upon a diamond in the rough so-to-speak. It could
  be worth investing in the interviewee (perhaps at a lower salary). All of this depends on whether
  you have capacity to absorb the individual *and* have mentors on your staff to polish those rough
  edges adequately. Keep in mind this can occur at any age (young or old) and/or experience level.
  Due to the nature of this particular quality, it can have a strong influence over other scores.

This can be further automated by using an internal application or spreadsheet. Each can be graded on
a scale of -1 to 1 where -1 is negative, 0 is neutral, and 1 is positive. Allow space for each team
member to record and explain notes for each score as well.

### V: Accept/Reject

Once review and final analysis of the candidate is concluded, it is time to either accept or reject
the candidate.

#### Accept

Upon acceptance, email the candidate with getting started instructions:

- Explain (or reiterate) the position, their role, and responsibilities.
- Provide agreed upon salary figures.
- Provide links for setting up payroll, health benefits, and whatever else is necessary.

#### Reject

Upon rejection of the candidate, be sure to respond quickly explaining *why* they were rejected in
addition to what you liked about them. When explaining disqualifying critirea, make sure to provide
resources on how they can improve. Though they didn't make it through the door this time, that
doesn't mean they could acquire the skills to try again. Remember, candidates go through a lot of
effort during the interview process so being able to reject them while being genuine and honest will
go a long way. Careers are long so leave candidates with a good impession of you and the company.
Candidates won't forget this. Planting this kind of good will as a first impression will go a long
way and, who knows, it might pay dividends in the future in surprising and interesting ways.
