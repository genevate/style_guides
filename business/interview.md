## Guidelines

- Reject Resumes - If they give you one, move on to the next candidate.
- Praise Portfolios:
  - Twitter (see communication/twitter, in this project, for details).
  - Syndicated Feeds (RSS) - Maintains, hosts, writes about experiences and passion.
  - GitHub - Has an active and well-maintained open source presense.
  - Other - Other sources of online precense such as Google+, Tumblr, Stack Overvflow, Quora, etc.
     count too.
  - If none of the above exist (or supplied via alternative sources), then move on to next
     candidate.
- Look for candidates that can write well.
  - Good writers means good communicators.
  - Introductory emails and/or excellent open source documentation is a great indicator.
- Don't Interview - Bring them in for an iteration (think of this as a contract to hire).
  - If the candidate is not employeed give them a week, otherwise give them two weeks if employeed.
  - Have the interviewee join the team discussion for planning (Monday) and assign actions for the
     week.
  - Collaborate and actively engage with the interviewee for the week, working on real business
     problems.
  - Go to lunch serveral times (or instant message) during the week(s) to get to know the
     interviewee better:
    - Is the interviewee humble, polite, and respectful to others?
    - Is the interviewee driven to pursuse work, hobbies, etc?
    - What does the team, as a whole, think?
  - *Important*: The entire team should be involved in the interview process and there must be team
     consensus in order to maintain team dynamics, culture, temperament, etc. moving forward. If you
     don't do this, you don't empower the team to grow as a whole and weakens the established
     camaraderie.
  - Have the interviewee demo what they worked on for the week (Friday) with the entire team.
  - Pay the interviewee for services/time rendered, evaluate performance, and then make the
     decision to hire/fire.
- Every interview takes time to prepare (i.e. reading online portfolios, reviewing open source
   code, searching for additional details, etc). If you don't want to put in the time, then don't do
   the interview.
- Always assemble a stellar interview team:
  - Train team members in the art of interviewing, never bring them in cold turkey.
  - Ensure every team member can provide comprehensive/constructive feedback of each interviewee.
  - Use members that keep a positive view of the company (ideally that is everyone).
  - Set everyone's expectation of the interviewee (*this is important*) to be someone better than
    each member was when they were first hired in order to keep raising the bar of the team.
- Once the initial impression of the interviewee is formed (usually within the first minute), spend
   the rest of the interview asking questions that will break that impression.
- Always take copius notes during the interview process in order to make detailed arguments for the
   pros and cons of the interviewee.
- Always strive to hire the best and brightest but realize that not everyone is a superstar - the
   interviewee should be able to augment the team, fill-in gaps, get things done, and have the
   potential for further growth (both personally and for the team).
- Always exit an interivew with a clear sense of whether the interviewee will strengthen the team,
   inspire change/new ideas, and improve the overall success of the company.

## Questions

- Start by talking about yourself, the team, and the company before questioning the inteviewee.
- Ask the interviewee to talk about him/herself and what drives them.
- Provide an environment that is non-threating and calm any nerves the interviewee might
  have/exhibit.
- Never ask questions that haven't been asked before or you don't have the answers to.
- Focus on specifics:
  - Probe for a start: "Give me an example of something you worked on?"
  - Dig for details: Ask who, what, where, when, why.
  - Differentiate: we vs. I, owner vs. leader, etc.
- Ask STAR (Situation, Task, Actions, and Results) questions:
  - What was the context of the problem you were trying to solve?
  - What tasks were you given?
  - What actions did you take?
  - What results did you measure?
- Ask the inteviewee to imagine what fellow co-workers would say their strengths and weaknesses are.
