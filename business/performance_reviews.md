# Performance Review Styles

Many companies perform some form of a periodic performance review. They are designed to help the
company evaluate their workforce and help you grow as an individual. The problem is *no one is 100%
invested in your growth, only you are*. With that in mind, the following describes how to take
control of this situation so it best benefits you and the company.

## Schedule

The schedule depends on you and what you are most comfortable with. *At a minimum, do this monthly.*
It's up to you to be disciplined about this as no one will care more than you. You can schedule this
as a recurring task in your task manager or as a calendar event, for example. Use whatever best fits
your workflow and *be diligent about it*.
