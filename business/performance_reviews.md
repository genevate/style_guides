# Performance Review Styles

> *If you want to see someone in real pain, watch someone who knows who [they are] and defaults on
> it on a regular basis.* -- Pat Murray

Many companies perform some form of a periodic performance review. They are designed to help the
company evaluate their workforce and help you grow as an individual. The problem is *no one is 100%
invested in your growth, only you are*. With that in mind, the following describes how to take
control of the situation so it best benefits you and the company.

## Preparation

> *This exercise requires and deserves time. Ideally, a personal retreat. At a minimum, several
> hours... [This] will boost your ability to see new horizons for your life and career.* -- Susan
> Scott

Get out of your normal environment and go to a different location. This can be a different part of
your house, public library, park, remote location in the woods, etc. Regardless of location, ensure
it is quiet and distraction free. Give yourself time and space to be honest with yourself.

## Schedule

The schedule depends on you and what you are most comfortable with. *At a minimum, do this monthly.*
It's up to you to be disciplined about this as no one will care more than you. You can schedule this
as a recurring action in your task manager or as a calendar event, for example. Use whatever best
fits your workflow and *be diligent about it*.
