Many companies perform some form of a periodic performance review. They are designed to help the
business evaluate their workforce and help you grow as an individual. The problem is *no one is 100%
invested in your growth, only you are*. With that in mind, the following describes how to take
control of the situation so it best benefits you and the business.

## Preparation

Get out of your normal environment and go to a different location. This can be a different part of
your house, public library, park, remote location in the woods, etc. Regardless of location, ensure
it is quiet and distraction free. Give yourself time and space to be honest with yourself.

## Schedule

The schedule depends on you and what you are most comfortable with. *At a minimum, do this monthly.*
It's up to you to be disciplined about this as no one will care more than you. You can schedule this
as a recurring action in your task manager or as a calendar event, for example. Use whatever best
fits your workflow and *be diligent about it*.

## Journal

When conducting your performance review, it's important to capture the answers to the questions
above. This can be done via a journaling app, a series of log files, or whatever fits your workflow.
Review these journal entries during each review and reflect upon them. The long tail of this
information will help you better understand your current trajectory and help you make informed
decisions on how to course correct if necessary.
