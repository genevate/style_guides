## Mission

To create an environment where the collective is empowered and inspired to reach their greatest
potential through autonomy, mastery, and purpose. It is by focusing on our staff that we can
delight, enrich, and astound our customers in ways impossible to imagine otherwise.

> People yearn to be connected to something of substance. They are oriented to values. How shall I
> live my life so that it means something more than a brief flash of biological existence soon to
> disappear forever?
>
> The best kind of vision statement answers four questions:
>
> 1. **Why are we here?** The answer to this question must get beyond identifying the product you
>    manufacture or the service you provide; it must answer the challenge “So what?” In other words,
>    what do we do for our customers that matters to them? Consider the compelling response of a
>    telecommunications company: “Our work brings the human family closer together.”
> 1. **What is our ideal relationship with one another?** How would we describe the best possible
>    relationship we could envision with everyone inside the organization? More compelling than “trust
>    and respect” are specific, actionable values such as: “We want consistency between our plans and
>    our actions. To disagree without fear. Each person to be connected with the final product.
>    Freedom to fail; people are shot only for not trying.”
> 1. **What is our ideal relationship with our customers?** Consider such responses as: “We act as
>    partners with our customers. We encourage them to teach us how to do business with them. Our
>    customers leave us feeling understood. We understand the impact of our actions on our customers.”
> 1. **What contribution do we wish to make to the local or global community?** What impact do we wish
>    to make in the larger community in which we are visible, beyond our customers? What do we want to
>    be known for? Examples: “We give our unconditional commitment to enhance the quality of life and
>    human growth,” and “We are committed to fulfilling our ethical and social responsibilities.”

## Core Values

- Be Human:
  - Prioritize yourself and family first, company second -- Allows you to be rooted in a solid
    foundation which, in turn, ensures a high functioning team.
  - People, not organizations, build software -- Cherish your staff more than your customers.
  - Outstanding software and teams can't be built without emotion –- *You have to care!*
- Be Learning:
  - A learning culture is an adaptable culture that is constantly growing and thinking of new ways
    to evolve. *Don't lose this.*
  - Teach instead of directing (including failures - which is the most important time to be learning
    and growing).
  - Embrace failure by letting everyone know it's normal, expected, and an important opportunity for
    learning.
  - Listen and consider everyone's input before making hasty judgements.
- Be Driven:
  - Work is not a place you go but something you do.
  - Provide each individual with the autonomy to work however they want with whatever tools they
    need to *get things done*.
  - Your schedule and hours worked are your own as long as you focus on *getting things done*.
  - Use dialog and debate to understand and solve complex problems.
  - Act upon your convictions.
- Be Disciplined:
  - One aspect of great products/services is that they are well maintained. As when caring for a
    plant, animal, and/or family member so too must the same be applied to a product/service. Once
    given life, constant vigilance, maintenance, and care must be provided on a regular basis.
- Be Augmented:
  - When detecting repeating patterns, be applying solutions for automating behavior.
  - Constantly curate and maintain software, services, scripts, etc. that allow you to do a lot with
    little. Overtime this becomes a toolbox, of sorts, you take with you everywhere you go that
    augments your experience and skills.
- [Be Responsible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E3xfR6IBII):
  - You are hired for your expertise and professionalism -- not for bragging rights, promotional
    capabilities, or a prized position of your boss/organization.
  - Avoid actions that waste your time, the customer's time, or the company's money.
  - Lead with questions, not answers -- Listen to and understand the *why* something is important.
  - Question *why* something is necessary -- Does the benefit outweigh the effort?
  - When performance is poor, clearly communicate why and provide the necessary support to turn the
    problem/weakness into a positive outcome.
  - Provide open and non-discriminatory communication for situations where conflict arises. Anyone
    can voice their concerns and be clearly heard, acknowledged, and understood. When individual
    space and/or team code of conduct is violated, decisive action is taken on the responsible
    culprits.
  - Conduct autopsies without blame -- Analyze, learn, and pivot instead.
- Be Diverse:
  - Be inclusive of different cultures, ethnicities, and genders.
  - A diverse team is a team that can tackle and solve complex situations more easily. Do not ignore
    this.
- [Be Civil](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/how-incivility-shuts-down-our-brains-at-work):
  - Improves focus and processing of information.
  - Helps individuals achieve their greatest potential.
- Be Appreciative:
  - Big or small, each contribution is valued and encouraged. Always.
  - Reward those who have drive, focus, discipline, and professional conduct instead of knowing
    everything.
  - Pay and compensation should be equal to or higher than the industry average. Period.
- Be Humble:
  - Keep a modest view of you own importance.
  - Be self-reflective and introspective of your actions and interactions with others and the work
    you do.
  - Avoid being vain and/or overly confident.
- Be Healthy:
  - Focus on a healthy mental/physical balance by taking time to walk outside, excercise, medidate,
    read, or anything that will help keep both your body and mind in a healthy state.
  - If overtime is put in, reward accordingly. Spurts are allowed but sustained overtime should be
    prevented to avoid burnout.
