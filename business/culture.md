## Core Values

- Be Human:
  - Prioritize yourself and family first, company second -- Taking care of yourself and/or family
    first allows you to remain awesome which, in turn, ensures a high functioning team.
  - People, not organizations, build software -- Cherish your employees more than your customers.
  - Outstanding software and teams can't be built without emotion –- *You have to care!*
- Be Learning:
  - A learning culture is an adaptable culture that is constantly growing and thinking of new ways
    to evolve. *Don't lose this.*
  - Listen and consider everyone's input before making hasty judgements.
  - Teach instead of directing (including failures - which is the most import time to be learning
    and growing).
- Be Empowered:
  - Work is not a place you go but something you do.
  - Provide each employee with the autonomy to work however they want with whatever tools they need
    to *get things done*.
  - Your schedule and hours worked are your own as long as you focus on *getting things done*.
  - Use dialog and debate to understand and solve complex problems.
  - Act upon your convictions.
- Be Responsible:
  - You are hired for your expertise and professionalism -- not for bragging rights, promotional
    capabilities, or a prized position of your boss/employeer.
  - Avoid actions that waste your time, the customer's time, or the company's money.
  - Lead with questions, not answers -- Listen to and understand the *why* of something.
  - Question *why* something is necessary -- Does the benefit outweigh the effort?
  - When performance is poor, clearly communicate why and provide the necessary support to turn the
    problem/weakness into a positive outcome.
  - Provide open and non-discriminatory communication for situations where conflict arises. Anyone
    can voice their concerns and be clearly heard, acknowledged, and understood. When individual
    space and/or team code of conduct is violated, decisive action is taken on the responsible
    culprits.
  - Conduct autopsies without blame -- Analyze, learn, and pivot instead.
- [Be Civil](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/how-incivility-shuts-down-our-brains-at-work)
  - Improves focus and processing of information.
  - Helps employees achieve their greatest potential.
- Be Appreciative:
  - Big or small, each employee's contribution is valued and encouraged. Always.
  - Reward people who have drive, focus, discipline, and professional conduct instead of knowing
    everything.
  - Pay and compensation should be equal to or higher than the industry average. Period.
- Be Healthy:
  - Focus on a healthy mental/physical balance.
  - If overtime is put in, reward accordingly. Spurts are allowed but sustained overtime should be
    prevented to avoid burnout.

### How to Determine Culture Fit

Here is how to research to determin if your values and the values of the company match:

- Read everything you can about the company by studying their website, videos, press releases, etc.
  Ask for access to the employee handbook too.
- Observe everything from quality of office equipment, office layout, work behavior, body language,
  facial expressions, etc.
- Talk to existing employees (important). You'll want to ask about office politics, historic
  turnover, how the leadership team behaves and acts.

### Behavior Improvement Exercises

The following is taken from [Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375569191&sr=8-1&keywords=Drive)
by Daniel H. Pink to encourage employee/team improvement:

0. Implement 20% time with training wheels (by starting at 10% and working up).
0. Allow members of a team to randomly give rewards for being exceptional at what they do.
0. Take an Autonomy Audit - On a scale of 1-10, rank the following (with 10 being the highest):
  0. How much autonomy do you have over your tasks in a given day?
  0. How much autonomy do you have over your time in a given day?
  0. How much autonomy do you have over your team (being able to choose the members you work with)?
  0. How much autonomy do you have over your technique (how you solve problems)?
0. Take three steps towards giving up control (Type-I bosses let members decide):
  0. Involve people in goal settings.
  0. Use non-controlling language.
  0. Hold "office hours" so that any employee can talk with you.
  0. Who's purpose is it?
  0. Test for pronouns. Do employees use "they" or "we/us". The latter is best.
  0. Design for intrinsic motivation. Give users autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
  0. Promote Goldilocks tasks (i.e. simple tasks that can be easily accomplished within harder
     tasks) for groups:
    0. Begin with a diverse team.
    0. Make the group a no-competition zone. Be collaborative/cooperative.
    0. Try task shifting. If a member is bored, shift to having that member teach another member
       what he/she knows.
    0. Animate with purpose, don't animate with rewards.
