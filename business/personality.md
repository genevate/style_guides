# Personality Styles

To effectively collaborate with others, it can be nice to describe the personalities of all members
of a team. This removes the awkwardness of getting to know someone and provides a foundation for
which to establish stronger bonds.

*Keep in mind, a personality is not meant to serve as a public interface that people are forced to
conform to in order to work with you.* Effort and collaboration with others is required to establish
strong bonds of trust. A personality is then meant to serve as a launching pad in order to help make
the bonding possible.

## Authenticity

Focus on being authentic and putting trust in others. This only works when everyone is onboard and
reciprocating these efforts. An authentic team is a team with strong bonds of trust and forgiviness
which is also a high functioning and learning team.

## Accountability

What you list in your personality, you *must* be accountable for. If people find you don't practice
what you preach; lack follow through; or behave in a manner not described, you will erorde trust
with the team. Hold yourself to accoountable, be open for feedback as well as praise, and a
willingness to grow instead.

## Roster

All team member profiles should be part of a company roster that is easy to lookup and search
through. Again, don't use this as a way to profile others but a chance to get to know someone
better.

## Profiles

Each team member should have the following profile information:

- **Avatar** - Needs to be a professional or semi-professional head shot of yourself.
- **Name** - Your full name.
- **Tagline** - A short one-sentence blurb that summarizes who you are.
- **Bio** - A few brief paragraphs that summaries your history.
- **Chronotype** - What are your best hours of productive, [well-rested](https://is.gd/TGguix)
  action.
- **Links** - Allow links to social media, web sites, source code, etc.
- **Personality** - See *questions* listed below. These should have protected access to team
  members only but can be marked public if desired.

## Questions

Each person on your team should fill out the answers to these questions. Be honest!

- What is your primary goal in life?
- Who is your hero and why?
- What brings out the best in you?
- What brings out the worst in you?

Due to constant growth, the answers to these questions will change. Setting aside time to review,
reflect, and update any changes is a *critical* part of the process. Ensure you are scheduling
time for upkeep on, at least, a monthly basis.
