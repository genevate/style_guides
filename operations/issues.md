## General

- Be disciplined about maintaining a zero-bug policy.

## Zero-Bug Classifications

- **Criticals**: These are emergency issues that are critical to the health and stability of your
  company. They must be dealt with immediately or you might loose the business. All work should be
  haulted until these issues are completely resolved.
- **Bugs**: These are important issues that need addressing but not immediately. They can be
  addressed after finishing current work. Don't pick up any new work until all bugs are addressed
  and resolved appropriately.
- **Enhancements**: Functionality that doesn't exist yet that would improve customer quality of life
  and/or give the existing system a competitive advantage. Work should not be started on these until
  all critical and/or bugs are resolved, *no exceptions!*
