# Basic Communication Styles

- Keep converstations digital (via internal syndicated feeds and/or group chat). Memory fades but a
  digital archive can last forever. Even better, it is searchable!
- Be positive. Write in an upbeat tone as body language is generally hard to communicate.
- Be transparent. Keep communication open, honest, and informative.
- Share with the company. Encourage people continually share company specific information that they
  are working on.
- Share with the world. Encourage people to setup their own web site with a syndicated feed, social
  media, etc. to talk about what they are passionate about.
