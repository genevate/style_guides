# Basic Communication Styles

- Keep conversations digital (via internal syndicated feeds and/or group chat). Memory fades but a
  digital archive can last forever. Even better, it is searchable!
- Be positive. Write in an upbeat tone as body language is generally hard to communicate.
- Be clear. Encourage well thought out discussions with plenty of background, context, and reasoning
  to support new ideas. This reduces confusion and clarification noise while allowing everyone to
  focus on contributing to the main discussion instead.
- Be transparent. Keep communication open, honest, and informative.
- Share with the company. Encourage people to continually share work related information.
- Share with the world. Encourage people to set up their own web site, with a syndicated feed, to
  share what they are passionate about.
- Avoid acronyms. Use of acronyms/abbreviations makes it hard for everyone to understand your mean
  (this is especially true of people new to the team). Acronyms might also be misinterpreted
  depending on people's context or lack there of. Spell out your meaning instead. Alternatively, use
  tools like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) or [Text Expander](https://textexpander.com) to
  automatically turn acronyms into readable phrases in order to type less and express yourself
  clearly to others.
