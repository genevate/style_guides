# Basic Communication Styles

0. Keep converstations digital (via internal syndicated feeds and/or group chat). Memory fades but a
   digital archive can last forever. Even better, it is searchable!
0. Be positive. Write in an upbeat tone as body language is generally hard to communicate.
0. Be transparent. Keep communication open, honest, and informative.
0. Share with the company. Encourage people continually share company specific information that they
   are working on.
0. Share with the world. Encourage people to setup their own web site with a syndicated feed,
   Twitter account, etc. to talk about what they are passionate about.
