# Twitter Styles

- Use [basic communication](basic.md) styles.
- Keep your tweets educational, entertaining, and relevant. Refrain from tweeting the mundane. Be
  creative.
- Try to average posting less than 5 tweets a day.
- Unfollow anyone that averages more than 5 tweets a day, brags about themselves and/or company,
  spams, etc. Your time is valuable. Respect it.
- Avoid retweeting compliments (bragging).
- Avoid dot replies (spam). Example: ". @example Reply text here." This causes your reply to show up
  in all of your followers streams who might not want to follow everyone that you follow. It also
  duplicates (spams) the tweet to a follower that follows both you and the person being replied to.
- Avoid enabling services that auto-tweet your activities. Examples: flight statuses, weight scales,
  etc. No one wants to read robotic speech.
- Don't promote your company (bragging). Use a corporate account for company-specific information
  instead.
- [Get Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done). Limit the reading of tweets
  to three times a day (example: morning, noon, and night) or less.
- [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Repeat_Yourself). Differentiate your
  tweets from your site feed and/or other syndicated services, otherwise you end up spamming
  followers and losing credibility.
- Practice [Inbox Zero](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero). Add to
  [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) items of interest for reading later, respond to
  those who have replied, and exit with your timeline caught up to the top.
- Use apps like [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) to save tweets that link to
  articles which require more time to read. This will allow you to fly through your timeline
  quickly.
- Use Twitterâ€™s native URL shortening service. This allows links to be shortened but retain original
  information about the URL so that it shows up, fully expanded, in your followers stream.
- Have fun but be *efficient* about it.
