# Twitter Styles

0. Use [basic communication](basic.md) styles.
0. Keep your tweets educational, entertaining, and relevant. Refrain from tweeting the mundane. Be
   creative.
0. Try to average posting less than 5 tweets a day.
0. Unfollow anyone that averages more than 5 tweets a day, brags about themselves and/or company,
   spams, etc. Your time is valuable. Respect it.
0. Avoid retweeting compliments (bragging).
0. Avoid dot replies (spam). Example: ". @example Reply text here." This causes your reply to show
   up in all of your followers streams who might not want to follow everyone that you follow. It
   also duplicates (spams) the tweet to a follower that follows both you and the person being
   replied to.
0. Avoid enabling services that auto-tweet your activities. Examples: flight statuses, weight
   scales, etc. No one wants to read robotic speech.
0. Don't promote your company (bragging). Use a corporate account for company-specific information
   instead.
0. [Get Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done). Limit the reading of tweets
   to three times a day (example: morning, noon, and night) or less.
0. [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Repeat_Yourself). Differentiate
   your tweets from your site feed and/or other syndicated services, otherwise you end up spamming
   followers and losing credibility.
0. Practice [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com). When reading your timeline, get to the top of the
   time quickly. [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) items of interest for later, respond to those who
   have replied, and exit with your timeline caught up to the top.
0. Use services like [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) to save tweets that link to articles which
   require more time to read. This will allow you to fly through your timeline quickly.
0. Use Twitterâ€™s native URL shortening service. This allows links to be shortened but retain
   original information about the URL so that it shows up, fully expanded, in your followers stream.
0. In the end, have fun but be efficient about it.
