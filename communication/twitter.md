# Twitter Styles

0. Keep your tweets educational, entertaining, and relevant. Refrain from tweeting the mundane. Be creative.
0. Try to average posting less than 5 tweets a day.
0. Unfollow anyone that averages more than 5 tweets a day, brags about themselves and/or company, spams, etc. Your
time is valuable. Respect it.
0. Don't retweet compliments (bragging).
0. Don't dot reply (spam). Example: ". @example Reply text here." This causes your reply to show up in all of your followers
streams who might not want to follow everyone that you follow. It also duplicates (spams) the tweet to a follower that
follows both you and the person being replied to.
0. Don't enable services that auto-tweet your activities. Examples: Path, Gowalla, FourSquare, flight statuses,
weight scales, etc. No one wants to read robotic speach.
0. Don't promote your company (bragging). Use a corporate account for company-specific information instead.
0. [Get Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done). Limit the reading of tweets to three times a
day (example: morning, noon, and night) or less.
0. [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Repeat_Yourself). Differentiate your tweets from your
site feed and/or other syndicated services, otherwise you end up spamming followers and losing credibility.
0. Practice [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com). When reading your timeline, get to the top of the time quickly.
[Pocket](http://getpocket.com) items of interest for later, respond to those who have replied, and exit with your
timeline caught up to the top.
0. Use services like [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) to save tweets that link to articles which require more time to
read. This will allow you to fly through your timeline quickly.
0. Use Twitter’s native URL shortening service. This allows links to be shortened but retain original information about
the URL so that it shows up, fully expanded, in your followers stream.
0. In the end, have fun but be efficient about it.
