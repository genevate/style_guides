# Email Styles

- Use [basic communication](basic.md) styles.
- Practice [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com). Keep the inbox at zero messages after checking for
  new updates.
- [Get Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done). Check, at most, three times
  a day (morning, noon, night). Completely exit out of the program when done.
- Avoid filters. If you find yourself setting up filters to deal with spam or automated messages, be
  assertive and ask whoever is sending them to stop. Use syndicated feeds or group chat instead.
- Avoid newletters. Email is the wrong format for this. Use forums, discussion boards, syndicated
  feeds, social networks, etc. instead.
- Use folders (sparingly). Folders are great for keeping messages organized but try to extract
  information out of email as much as possible. Apps like
  [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus), [Evernote](https://evernote.com), etc.
  can make this easier.
- Use descriptive subjects. Compose each email with a subject line revelant to the content being
  sent.
- Use searchable subjects. Use keywords and phrases that pertain to the content, and easy to read,
  but also searchable.
- Avoid signatures (especially images). It is tempting to add an email signature to each message but
  they quickly becomes redundant and repetive afterwards. Plus it slows down syncing across mobile
  devices.
