## Advantages

- Asynchronous communication for distributed staff.
- Transparent communication and participation for all.
- Historic record of conversations which can be searched and linked.

## General

- Use [basic communication](basic.md) styles.
- Use group chat software. Example: [Slack](https://slack.com).
- Prefer channels that provide high signal to noise. Otherwise, leave or mute channels of low value
  or high noise.
- Mute channels that are of interest but don't require constant attention. Schedule a reminder via
  your task manager to catch up on these channels daily.
- Install both desktop and mobile applications for convenience and coverage.

## Channels

Use channels to keep information organized around major topics. For example, consider the following
structure:

- **General** - Dedicated to general communication, discussions, questions, etc.
- **News** - Dedicated to official company news and updates.
- **Kudos** - Dedicated to praising others who have done an excellent job or for being awesome in
  general.
- **Emergencies** - Dedicated to production alerts/emergencies that must be addressed immediately.
  - Use for emergencies only.
  - Ensure notifications are always enabled.
- **Notifications** - Dedicated to non-human messages like Git updates, build failures, deployments,
  etc.
- **Marketing** - Dedicated to public promotional/awareness and sales efforts.
- **Engineering** - Dedicated to technical news, discussions, questions, etc. related to software
  engineering.
- **Learnings** - Dedicated to sharing links, lessons learned, tips, tricks, etc.
- **Demos** - Dedicated to sharing completed work and accomplishments that would be exciting for
  others to learn about, discuss, provide feedback on, etc.
- **Events** - Dedicated to information related to conferences, after hours gatherings, personal
  adventures, or anything of interest that others might want to participate in.

When using channels, keep to the following:

- Avoid sending `@here`, `@all`, `@everyone`, etc. messages. A channel is meant for *asynchronous*
  communication and these types of messages defeat that purpose. If a channel doesn't have these
  messages disabled by default, ensure notifications of this type are disabled by manually editing
  the channel notification settings.
- Use channels instead of direct messages. Lead by example and initiate or respond to direct
  messages in channels so others are encouraged to do the same. Even if you are composing the
  message to a single person or part of the team, it's still useful for others to know what is going
  on. If receiving a direct message, ask if it can be responded to in the appropriate channel
  instead.
- Avoid creating random channels. Be judicious in what constitutes bringing a new channel into
  existence by identifiying information that might be too noisy for one channel but could benefit
  from having it's own channel.
- Avoid maintaining channels with low activity or have outlived their existence by
  archiving/deleting them as necessary.

## Reactions

Reactions are [emoticons](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet) that can be applied to
messages posted by team members.

There are several reasons reactions are useful:

- Convey emotion when text isn't enough.
- Say a lot with little -- As they say, an image is worth a 1,000 words.
- Provide feedback without alerting others. This is especially handy in keeping channel
  notifications to a minimum so others are not constantly distracted.
- Let others know your voice was heard even if someone didn't have anything to say in direct
  response to your message.

While the list of emoticons is vast, it is best to standardize on emoticons that have a consistent
meaning as using every possible emoticon can be confusing. Here is a recommended list and the
message each conveys:

- :white_check_mark: - Indicates approval, the task requested of you has been completed, or the task
  is aleady done.
- :bookmark: - Indicates you can't read the document immediately but will soon *or* you've read,
  liked, and bookmarked the document for future reference.
- :cool: - Indicates message is...well...cool.
- :tada: - Indicates enthusiasm/excitement.
- :star: - Indicates you favorited/liked the message.
- :sunflower: - Indicates giving flowers to someone you wish will heal up and feel better soon.
- :joy: - Indicates joy/laughter in response to something silly/funny.
- :eyes: - Indicates you are reading/reviewing the posted message and plan to respond shortly.
- :rocket: - Indicates enthusiastic movement, progress, and/or forward traction related to message.
- :ok: - Indicates acknowledgement of a posted message.
- :thought_balloon: - Indicates you are pondering the message for future consideration or might
  respond to the message at a later time.
- :bow: - Indicates thankfulness/gratefulness.
