## Advantages

- Asynchronous communication for distributed staff.
- Transparent communication and participation for all.
- Historic record of conversations which can be searched and linked.

## General

- Use [basic communication](basic.md) styles.
- Use group chat software. Example: [Slack](https://slack.com).
- Prefer channels that provide high signal to noise. Otherwise, leave or mute channels of low value
  or high noise.
- Mute channels that are of interest but don't require constant attention. Schedule a reminder via
  your task manager to catch up on these channels daily.
- Install both desktop and mobile applications for convenience and coverage.

## Channels

Use channels to keep information organized around major topics. For example, consider the following
structure:

- **General** - Dedicated to general communication, discussions, questions, etc.
- **News** - Dedicated to official company news and updates.
- **Kudos** - Dedicated to praising others who have done an excellent job or for being awesome in
  general.
- **Emergencies** - Dedicated to production alerts/emergencies that must be addressed immediately.
  - Use for emergencies only.
  - Ensure notifications are always enabled.
- **Notifications** - Dedicated to non-human messages like Git updates, build failures, deployments,
  etc.
- **Marketing** - Dedicated to public promotional/awareness and sales efforts.
- **Engineering** - Dedicated to technical news, discussions, questions, etc. related to software
  engineering.
- **Learnings** - Dedicated to sharing links, lessons learned, tips, tricks, etc.
- **Demos** - Dedicated to sharing completed work and accomplishments that would be exciting for
  others to learn about, discuss, provide feedback on, etc.
- **Events** - Dedicated to information related to conferences, after hours gatherings, personal
  adventures, or anything of interest that others might want to participate in.

When using channels, keep to the following:

- When creating channels, ensure there is a *topic* which is a brief sentence on *what* the channel
  is about. The channel topic generally shows up at the top of the channel and is the first thing
  people will want to read when determining whether to join a channel or when forgetting what the
  channel is about. Next, ensure the channel's *purpose* is defined. This generally appears in the
  information/details section of the channel and explains *why* the channel exists. The *purpose* is
  meant to support the *topic* and should be a brief paragraph (or two) which further explains why
  the channel is important. Supporting links, references, etc. can be included in the *topic* and
  *purpose* descriptions as necessary.
- Use channels instead of direct messages. Lead by example and initiate or respond to direct
  messages in channels so others are encouraged to do the same. Even if you are composing the
  message to a single person or part of the team, it's still useful for others to know what is going
  on. If receiving a direct message, ask if it can be responded to in the appropriate channel
  instead. Encouraging public discussion allows participation from everyone and reinforces a culture
  of inclusion, trust, and transparency.
- Use threads when responding to messages in a channel. This allows for detailed discussions to form
  around a topic which anyone can follow for further updates if necessary. Doing this also prevents
  the channel from being interspersed with multiple discussions going on at once which are confusing
  to read and/or follow.
- Avoid sending `@here`, `@all`, `@everyone`, etc. messages. A channel is meant for *asynchronous*
  communication and these types of messages defeat that purpose. If a channel doesn't have these
  messages disabled by default, ensure notifications of this type are disabled by manually editing
  the channel notification settings.
- Avoid heavy use of individual's handles (i.e. `@jane`, `@joe`, etc.) when messaging others. Unless
  it is truly urgent or know they are currently watching the channel, avoid using handles so
  individuals are not spammed with notifications. Remember, group chat is meant for *asynchronous*
  commmunication and shouldn't need immediate attention.
- Avoid creating random channels. Be judicious in what constitutes bringing a new channel into
  existence by identifiying information that might be too noisy for one channel but could benefit
  from having it's own channel.
- Avoid maintaining channels with low activity or have outlived their existence by
  archiving/deleting them as necessary.

## Reactions

Reactions are [emoticons](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet) that can be applied to
messages posted by team members.

There are several reasons reactions are useful:

- Convey emotion when text isn't enough.
- Say a lot with little -- As they say, an image is worth a 1,000 words.
- Provide feedback without alerting others. This is especially handy in keeping channel
  notifications to a minimum so others are not constantly distracted.
- Let others know your voice was heard even if someone didn't have anything to say in direct
  response to your message.

While the list of emoticons is vast, it is best to standardize on emoticons that have a consistent
meaning as using every possible emoticon can be confusing. Here is a recommended list and the
message each conveys:

- :white_check_mark: (`:white_check_mark:`) - Indicates approval, the task requested of you has been
  completed, or the task is aleady done.
- :bookmark: (`:bookmark:`) - Indicates you can't read the document immediately but will soon *or*
  you've read, liked, and bookmarked the document for future reference.
- :cool: (`:cool:`) - Indicates message is...well...cool.
- ![disbelief](https://www.alchemists.io/images/emoji/disbelief.png) (`:disbelief:`) - Indicates disbelief.
- :tada: (`:tada:`) - Indicates enthusiasm/excitement.
- :star: (`:star:`) - Indicates you favorited/liked the message.
- :sunflower: (`:sunflower:`) - Indicates giving flowers to someone you wish will heal up and feel
  better soon.
- :thought_balloon: (`:thought_balloon`) - Indicates you find the feedback interesting, are thinking
  about what was said, and/or are considering responding.
- ![:dancing_penguin:](https://www.alchemists.io/images/emoji/dancing-penguin.gif) (`:dancing_penguin:`) -
  Indicates joy in response to something fun.
- :eyes: (`:eyes:`) - Indicates you are reading/reviewing the posted message and plan to respond
  shortly.
- ![nod](https://www.alchemists.io/images/emoji/nod.gif) (`:nod:`) - Indicates agreement.
- :ok: (`:ok:`) - Indicates acknowledgement.
- :rocket: (`:rocket:`) - Indicates enthusiastic progress, and/or forward traction.
- :bow: (`:bow:`) - Indicates thankfulness/gratefulness.
- :sweat_smile: (`:sweat_smile:`) - Indicates a positive worry, nervousness, embarrassment, or
  hesitation.
- :arrow_up: (`:arrow_up:`) - Indicates emphasis/importance of statement.

## Statuses

While it is tempting to post a message regarding your status, it's unnecessary due to being able to
update your status via the `/status` command. This accomplishes two important aspects of
communication:

1. Provides a visual indication to others of your status so they can hover over your name to learn
   of your status, see the status change in current discussions, and/or see your status via search.
1. Avoids notifying the team of your status change so as not to disrupt everyone's workflow.

Emoji's can help too. Examples:

- `/status :rice: Lunch`
- `/status :racing_motorcycle: Traveling`
- `/status :books: Craft/Skill Training`

Be creative and brief. Using a word or two is best.
