## General

- Use [basic communication](basic.md) styles.
- Provides the following:
  - Keeps communication asynchronous.
  - Provides transparent communication so that all staff may participate that have interest.
  - Ensures automatic history for old conversations which can be searched and resurfaced.
  - Enables remote/mobile access for those traveling or constantly on the move.
- Use group chat software for asynchronous communication. Example: [Slack](https://slack.com).

## Channels

Structure company-wide channels as follows:

- **General** - General communication, discussions, questions, etc.
- **News** - Official company alerts, news, and updates.
- **Kudos** - A place to praise others who have done an excellent job or for being awesome in
  general.
- **Emergencies** - Restricted to discussion of production alerts/emergencies that must be addressed
  immediately.
  - Keep this chat open at all times (especially when on-call).
  - Ensure notifications are enabled for your mobile device.
- **Notifications** - For automated notifications and non-human messages like Git updates, build
  failures, deployments, etc.
- **Sales** - News related to customer sign-up, revenue earned, contracts signed, etc.
  - Try to limit information to *(customer/contract) - (new revenue earned)*.
  - Try to limit responses so the room doesn't get too noisy...excitement is
    inevitable/understandable, though.
- **Marketing** - News related to global/public promotional/awareness efforts.
- **Engineering** - Common area for technical news, discussions, questions, etc. related to software
  engineering.
- **Learnings** - A place for sharing links, things learned, tips and tricks, etc.
- **Demos** - A place for sharing completed work that would be exciting for others to see, discuss,
  be aware of, get feedback on, etc.
- **Events** - News and information related to after hour gatherings, adventures, etc.

## Reactions

Reactions are [emoticons](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet) that can be applied to
messages posted by team members.

There are several reasons reactions are useful:

- They convey emotion when text isn't enough.
- They say a lot with little -- Sometimes an image is worth a 1,000 words.
- They provide feedback without alerting others. This is especially handy in keeping channel
  notifications at a minimum so others are not constantly distracted.
- They help let others know that your voice was heard even if someone didn't have anything to say in
  direct response to your message.

While the list of emoticons is vast, it is best to standardize on emoticons that have a consistent
meaning as using every possible emoticon can be confusing. Here is a recommended list and the
message each conveys:

- :white_check_mark: - Indicates approval, the task requested of you has been completed, or the task
  is aleady done.
- :bookmark: - Indicates you can't read the document immediately but will soon *or* you've read,
  liked, and bookmarked the document for future reference.
- :cool: - Indicates message is...well...cool.
- :tada: - Indicates enthusiasm/excitement.
- :star: - Indicates you favorited/liked the message.
- :sunflower: - Indicates giving flowers to someone you wish will heal up and feel better soon.
- :joy: - Indicates joy/laughter in response to something silly/funny.
- :eyes: - Indicates you are reading/reviewing the posted message and plan to respond shortly.
- :rocket: - Indicates enthusiastic movement, progress, and/or forward traction related to message.
- :ok: - Indicates acknowledgement of a posted message.
- :thought_balloon: - Indicates you are pondering the message for future consideration or might
  respond to the message at a later time.
- :bow: - Indicates thankfulness/gratefulness.

## Tips

- Prefer chat rooms that provide value and are critical to getting the job done. The rest can be
  entered as time allows.
- Limit notifications for rooms that are too noisy/distracting. Some clients allow notifications to
  be silenced per room so room distractions can be limited.
- For the noisest of group chats, consider muting and then checking three times a day (morning,
  noon, and night) as done for [email styles](email.md).
- Most group chat services provide desktop and mobile applications. Install both.
