# Group Chat Styles

## General

- Use [basic communication](basic.md) styles.
- Provides the following:
  - Keeps communication asynchronous.
  - Provides transparent communication so that all staff may participate that have interest.
  - Ensures automatic history for old conversations which can be searched and resurfaced.
  - Enables remote/mobile access for those traveling or constantly on the move.
- Use group chat software for asynchronous communication. Example: [Slack](https://slack.com).

## Channels

Structure company-wide channels as follows:

- General - General company level communications, discussions, questions, etc.
- Announcements - Official company alerts, news, and updates.
- Emergencies - Production level issues that must be addressed immediately.
  - Keep this chat open at all times (especially when on-call).
  - Ensure notifications are enabled for your mobile device.
- Sales - News related to customer sign-up, revenue earned, contracts signed, etc.
  - Try to limit the information to simply *(customer/contract) - (new revenue earned)*.
  - Try to limit responses so the room doesn't get too noisy...excitement is
    inevitable/understandable, though.
- Marketing - News related to global/public promotional/awareness efforts.
- Development - General technical news, discussions, etc. related to software development.
- (team) - Team specific news. Use the following sub-structure (create the same structure per team):
  (see [Iterations](../business/iterations.md) for more info):
  - (team) Plans - For start of week planning.
  - (team) Standups - For daily member status updates (i.e. yesterday, today, blockers).
  - (team) Retrospectives - For end-of-week retrospectives.
- Development Notifications - For automated notifications like Git updates, build failures,
  deployments, etc.
- Status - For out-of-office messages, errands, sickness, upcoming vacation reminders, etc.
- Demos - For end-of-week demos to show off the week's cumulative work. Doesn't have to be limited
  to end-of-week but can be anytime there is something of interest to share.
- Events - News and information related to after hours adventures, gatherings, etc. Examples:
  - Snow - Ski/snowboarding information and events.
  - Games - Video/board game information and events.

## Reactions

Reactions are [emoticons](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet) that can be applied to
messages posted by team members.

There are several reasons reactions are useful:

- They convey emotion when text isn't enough.
- They say a lot with very little. As they say...sometimes an image is worth a 1,000 words.
- They provide feedback without alerting others. This is especially handy in keeping channel
  notifications at a minimum so others are not constantly distracted.
- They help let others know that your voice was heard even if someone didn't have anything to say in
  direct response to your post.

While the list of emoticons is vast and growing, it is best to standardize on emoticons that have a
consistent meaning as using every possible emoticon can be confusing. Here is a recommended list and
the message they convey:

- :white_check_mark: - Indicates approval, the task requested of you has been completed, or the task
  is aleady done.
- :bookmark: - Indicates you can't read a posted link, article, etc. immediately but will in the
  future.
- :cool: - Indicates a posted message is...well...cool.
- :tada: - Indicates enthusiasm/excitement to a posted message.
- :star: - Indicates you favorited/liked a posted message.
- :pill: - Indicates you wish someone to heal up who might not be feeling well.
- :eyes: - Indicates you are reading/reviewing the posted message and plan to respond shortly.
- :ok: - Indicates acknowledgement of a posted message.
- :thought_balloon: - Indicates you are pondering the posted message and that you may or may not
  respond immediately.
- :bow: - Indicates thankfulness/gratefulness of a posted message.

## Tips

- Prefer chat rooms that provide value and are critical to getting the job done. The rest can be
  entered as time allows.
- Limit notifications for rooms that are too noisy/distracting. Some clients allow notifications to
  be silenced per room so room distractions can be limited.
- For the noisest of group chats, consider muting and then checking three times a day (morning,
  noon, and night) like good [email styles](email.md).
- Most group chat services provide desktop and mobile applications. Install both.
